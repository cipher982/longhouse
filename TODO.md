# TODO

Capture list for substantial work. Not quick fixes (do those live).

## For Agents

- Each entry is a self-contained handoff — read it, you have context to start
- Size (1-10) indicates scope: 1 = hour, 5 = day, 10 = week+
- Check off subtasks as you go so next agent knows state
- Add notes under tasks if you hit blockers or learn something

Classification tags (use on section headers): [Launch], [Product], [Infra], [QA/Test], [Docs/Drift], [Tech Debt], [Brand]

## [Product] ✅ Jobs Pack Reliability + Legacy Secrets Bridge (5)

**Goal:** Make external jobs packs load reliably (deps + manifest resilience) and ensure legacy `os.getenv()` jobs see DB-stored secrets safely.

- [x] Install job pack deps at manifest load (single code path, no `--no-deps`)
- [x] Add safe legacy env injection with concurrency guard (registry + queue)
- [x] Add deps/install + env-injection tests in `apps/zerg/backend/tests_lite/`
- [x] Update sauron-jobs: `requirements.txt` + manifest import guards + secret declarations
- [x] Verify: `make test` + `make test-e2e`

## [Infra] ✅ Control Plane OpenAI Proxy Injection (1)

**Goal:** Inject LiteLLM proxy creds into instances and reprovision david010 so jobs can use OPENAI-compatible APIs.

- [x] Add instance OpenAI settings + provisioner env injection + docs
- [x] Set `CONTROL_PLANE_INSTANCE_OPENAI_API_KEY` + `CONTROL_PLANE_INSTANCE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` in Coolify
- [x] Deploy control plane and reprovision david010
- [ ] Seed david010 job secrets via API (LLM_BENCH_MONGODB_URI, LIFE_HUB_DB_URL, LIFE_HUB_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN)

**Notes (2026-02-16):** Instances route through LiteLLM proxy at `llm.drose.io`. All API calls must include `extra_body={"metadata": {"source": "longhouse:component"}}`. gpt-5-nano + text-embedding-3-small added to proxy allowlist. DB-stored LlmProviderConfig rows can silently override env var keys — deleted stale row on david010 to fix 401s.

## [Infra] ✅ Runtime Image Dependency Fix (1)

**Goal:** Instance boots cleanly (zstandard missing in runtime image).

- [x] Add `zstandard` to backend deps
- [x] Push + wait for GHCR runtime build
- [x] Reprovision david010 and verify `/api/health`

---

## [Product] 🧠 Harness Simplification & Commis-to-Timeline (8)

**Goal:** Stop building our own agent harness. Lean on CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI). Make commis output visible in the timeline. Remove ~25K LOC of dead code.

**Spec:** `apps/zerg/backend/docs/specs/unified-memory-bridge.md` (renamed: Harness Simplification)

### Phases 1-2: Commis->Timeline + Deprecate Standard Mode
> Archived -- 100% complete. Workspace-only mode, timeline ingest, environment filter, source badges, CommisRunner removed (~2.7K LOC). See git history.

### Phase 3: Slim Oikos (5)

**Architecture:** Single toolbox, many agents. All ~60 tools stay as a library. Each agent (Oikos, commis, future) is configured with a subset.

**3a-3e: Archived -- 100% complete.**
> Loop simplified (oikos_react_engine, message_builder, fiche_runner). Tool infra flattened (catalog/unified_access removed, ~1.1K LOC). 9 services decoupled from FicheRunner. Memory consolidated (3 systems -> 2 + KV). Skills progressive disclosure + AGENTS.md chain + skill format docs. See git history for details.

**Remaining 3a items (deferred):**
- [ ] Implement Oikos dispatch contract from spec: direct vs quick-tool vs CLI delegation, with explicit backend intent routing (Claude/Codex/Gemini) and repo-vs-scratch delegation modes
- [ ] Use Claude Compaction API (server-side) or custom summarizer for "infinite thread" context management

Research doc: `docs/specs/3a-deferred-research.md` — both items evaluated and deferred (commit 16c531e6)

**3f: Longhouse MCP Server — expose toolbox to CLI agents (3)**

Industry standard pattern (2025-2026): teams expose internal tooling as MCP servers so CLI agents access shared context mid-task. See VISION.md § "Longhouse MCP Server" for architecture.

- [x] Implement MCP server exposing: `search_sessions`, `get_session_detail`, `memory_read`/`memory_write`, `notify_oikos` (commit `e1207ef2`)
- [x] Support stdio transport (for local hatch subprocesses) and streamable HTTP (for remote/runner agents) (commit `e1207ef2`)
- [x] Auto-register MCP server in Claude Code settings during `longhouse connect --install` (commit `e1207ef2`)
- [x] Auto-configure MCP server for commis spawned via `hatch` (inject into workspace `.claude/settings.json`) (commit `d849ec8d`)
- [x] Add Codex `config.toml` MCP registration path for Codex-backend commis

**3g: Commis quality gates via hooks (2)**

Verification loops (tests/browser checks before commit) boost agent reliability 2-3x (industry consensus 2025-2026). Inject quality gates into commis workspaces.

- [x] Define default commis hook set: `Stop` hook runs `make test` (or configured verify command) before allowing completion
- [x] Inject hooks into commis workspace `.claude/settings.json` at spawn time
- [x] Make verify command configurable per-project (default: `make test` if Makefile exists, else skip)
- [x] Report hook failures back to Oikos via `notify_oikos` MCP tool (when 3f lands)

**3h: Research — Codex App Server protocol + Claude Agent SDK (1)**

Evaluate newer integration paths for tighter commis control vs. current hatch subprocess approach.

- [x] Evaluate Codex App Server (JSON-RPC over stdio) for structured event streaming from Codex-backend commis — Thread/Turn/Item primitives + approval routing
- [x] Evaluate Claude Agent SDK (TypeScript) as alternative to `hatch` subprocess for Claude-backend commis — real-time streaming, programmatic tool injection, better lifecycle control
- [x] Document trade-offs and recommend path forward (subprocess vs SDK vs protocol) — see `docs/specs/3h-research-commis-integration.md`

### Phase 3.5: Session Processing Module + Briefing (5)

**Spec:** `docs/specs/session-processing-module.md`
**Handoff:** `docs/handoffs/2026-02-11-session-processing-discovery.md`

**Goal:** Pre-computed session summaries injected into Claude Code AI context at startup. No other tool does cross-session context injection — differentiating feature.

**Discovery (2026-02-11):** The SessionStart hook (`~/.claude/hooks/longhouse-session-start.sh`) uses `systemMessage` (human-only display). The AI receives nothing. Fix: use `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.

**Phase 1 — Core module + hook fix:**
- [x] Fix SessionStart hook: add `additionalContext` alongside `systemMessage` in `longhouse-session-start.sh` (commit `ac64e0c`)
- [x] Create `zerg/services/session_processing/` module: `content.py`, `tokens.py`, `transcript.py` (commit `355abaab`)
- [x] Golden tests: 112 tests covering noise stripping, redaction, token counting, transcript building (commits `355abaab`, `d6b038fa`)
- [x] Add `summarize.py` with `quick_summary()` + `structured_summary()` + `batch_summarize()` (commit `fb728619`)

**Phase 2 — Briefing pipeline:**
- [x] Add `summary` + `summary_title` columns to `AgentSession` (commit `fb728619`)
- [x] Wire async summary generation into ingest path via `BackgroundTasks` (commit `fb728619`)
- [x] Add `GET /api/agents/briefing?project=X` endpoint with `BriefingResponse` model (commit `fb728619`)
- [x] Update SessionStart hook to call briefing endpoint with fallback to raw sessions list (commit `ac64e0c`)
- [x] Sanitize injected content — safety labels in `format_briefing_context()` (commit `fb728619`)

**Phase 3 — Refactor existing consumers:**
- [x] Migrate `daily_digest.py` to use `session_processing.transcript` + `session_processing.summarize` — replaced inline transcript building, noise stripping, and LLM calls with `build_transcript()` + `quick_summary()`
- [x] Consolidate `safe_parse_json` — exported from `session_processing`, replaced duplicates in `memory_summarizer.py` and `title_generator.py`
- [x] Delete duplicate inline logic — removed `_safe_parse_json` from memory_summarizer + title_generator, removed inline message classes and noise patterns from daily_digest
- [x] Add `POST /api/agents/backfill-summaries` one-shot endpoint + tests to summarize legacy `summary IS NULL` sessions in bounded batches

### Phase 4: Agent Infrastructure Consolidation (8)

**Spec:** `docs/specs/agent-infrastructure-consolidation.md` (v3, Codex-reviewed)
**Goal:** Migrate embeddings, semantic search, recall, insights, and file reservations from Life Hub → Longhouse. Cut over MCP.

**Phase 1 — Foundation (sequential):**
- [x] Fix Gemini `raw_json=""` gap in `shipper/providers/gemini.py`
- [x] Add embedding config to `config/models.json` + `models_config.py` loader
- [x] Add `SessionEmbedding` model + `needs_embedding` column on `AgentSession` + import in `database.py`
- [x] Embedding client (Gemini default, OpenAI alt) + sanitize with `strip_noise`/`redact_secrets`
- [x] Chunking pipeline (`session_processing/embeddings.py`) with event index mapping
- [x] Wire into ingest (BackgroundTask, independent of summary success)
- [x] Backfill endpoint (`POST /api/agents/backfill-embeddings`)

**Phase 1 — Track A (depends on foundation):**
- [x] Embedding cache (in-memory numpy array, lazy-load turn-level)
- [x] Upgrade `search_sessions` MCP tool (semantic mode, hybrid FTS+rerank)
- [x] Add `recall` MCP tool (chunk-level search + event window retrieval)

**Phase 1 — Track B (independent, can parallel):**
- [x] Insights table + `POST /api/insights` + `GET /api/insights` + MCP tools (`log_insight`, `query_insights`)
- [x] File reservations table + API + MCP tools (`reserve_file`, `check_reservation`, `release_reservation`)

**Phase 1 — Tests:**
- [x] `tests_lite/test_embeddings.py`, `test_insights.py`, `test_reservations.py`, `test_semantic_search.py`

### Phase 5: Historical Backfill + Cutover (David-specific) (3)

**Depends on:** Phase 4 complete. **Status: Nearly Complete**

- [x] Backfill ~270 missing sessions from Life Hub — All 230 cursor + 6 swarmlet sessions migrated via direct SQLite INSERT (API rate limits made REST approach impractical). Used `scripts/migrate_sessions_direct.py`.
- [x] Backfill embeddings for all sessions — **RUNNING** in background (~0.9/s, OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, 715/9409 done). Script: `scripts/backfill_embeddings.py` running inside container at `/data/backfill_embeddings.py`.
- [x] Migrate insights history from Life Hub — 241 insights migrated via POST /api/insights
- [x] Dual-test: query both Life Hub and Longhouse, compare results — Longhouse is a superset (10,936 sessions vs Life Hub 4,971). Session counts higher per-day due to sub-agent capture.
- [x] Update `longhouse connect --install` to register expanded MCP tools — already worked, ran successfully
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md global instructions to use Longhouse MCP — updated research tools section + project table
- [x] Remove Life Hub MCP from Claude Code config — removed from `~/.claude.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml`
- [ ] Life Hub agents schema → read-only archive — deferred (smart home + tasks still active on Life Hub)

## [Launch] 🎯 HN Launch Priority (This Week)

**Decision:** OSS GA + Hosted Beta in parallel (50/50 positioning). No "OSS-first" bias in copy/CTAs.

### P0 — Launch Core (Required)
> ✅ **Archived** — All 6 P0 items complete (auth, demo, CTAs, README, FTS5, QA). See git history.

### P1 — Hosted Beta (Stretch)
| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Control Plane Scaffold | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Docker Provisioning | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Google OAuth (control plane) | Not started |
| 4 | Stripe Integration | Not started |
| 5 | Cross-subdomain Auth | Not started |
| 6 | Landing Page Integration | Not started |

**Minimum for launch:** P0 only (self-hosted works end-to-end). Full signup flow tracked in [Full Signup Flow section](#infra-full-signup-flow-8).

---

## [Launch] Post-GA Follow-ups (From 2026-02-03 Swarm)

> ✅ **Archived** — All 5 items complete (rate limiting, hash support, UI fallback, demo-fresh, workflow removal). See git history.

---

## [Infra] ⚠️ Architecture Reality Check (Read First)

**VISION.md describes per-user isolated instances. This is NOW REAL for david010.**

Current reality (as of 2026-02-15):
- **Control plane deployed** at `control.longhouse.ai` (Coolify app `longhouse-control-plane`)
- **david010 instance** is a real isolated container provisioned by the control plane with its own SQLite DB
- **Marketing site** at `longhouse.ai` (Coolify app `longhouse-demo`)
- **Platform-provided email** — Control plane injects SES credentials into instances during provisioning; instances can send email out of the box
- **SSO login** — Control plane issues JWT tokens for cross-subdomain auth
- **Remaining gaps:** Google OAuth credentials not configured on control plane (manual provisioning only), Stripe integration not wired

**Target state:** Full signup flow: Google OAuth → Stripe checkout → auto-provision. See VISION.md for architecture.

See this file for the current launch analysis.

---

## [Product] Landing Page Redesign — Full (6)

**Goal:** Clear user paths, visible CTAs, better contrast. Visitor instantly understands: what it is, who it's for, how to get started.

**⚠️ DEPENDS ON LAUNCH DECISION:**
- **Dual-path (current):** Hosted beta + self-hosted parity in copy and CTAs

Current copy is a mix of both stories. Align to dual-path parity.

**Problems identified (2026-02-05):**
1. ✅ FIXED: Hero CTAs were ghost + not dual-path (both self-host + hosted now visible)
2. Colors too dark — low contrast text, cards blend into background
3. ✅ FIXED: Explicit self-host vs hosted paths (hosted waitlist + self-host install in hero/CTA)
4. ✅ FIXED: Story copy overpromises cross-provider + FTS5 + resume-anywhere
5. ✅ FIXED: CTAs now route to pricing/install (sign-in only when explicitly chosen)

### Phases 1-4: Header, User Paths, Contrast, Hero CTAs
> Archived -- all complete. Sticky header, dual-path CTAs, DeploymentOptions, WCAG contrast fixes, hero restructure. See git history.

**Remaining Phase 2 items:**
- [x] Tertiary link: "Enterprise -->" below hero
- [x] Add comparison table: who runs it, data residency, support, upgrade path

### Phase 5: Story Alignment (2 hours)

Update copy to match VISION.md value prop: Timeline + Search + Resume.

**Hero copy:**
- [x] Headline: "Never lose an AI coding conversation" (or similar)
- [x] Subhead: "Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini sessions in one searchable timeline." (multi-provider now ships — parsers landed 2026-02-10)
- [x] Note: "Local-first. Self-host anytime. Hosted beta waitlist."

**How It Works:**
- [x] Step 1: "Install" → Ships sessions from Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI
- [x] Step 2: "Search" → Keyword search now (FTS5-powered)
- [x] Step 3: "Resume" → Forum resume is Claude-only; Timeline resume planned

**Cut/minimize:**
- [x] IntegrationsSection — kept as "Session Sources" (provider sync status is core story); moved up after HowItWorks
- [x] SkillsSection — collapsed to compact single-line mention; moved below Pricing
- [x] Move Oikos chat to "Features" section, not hero — verified: Oikos is not mentioned anywhere on landing page; hero correctly focuses on Timeline + Search + Resume (commit 98f7a45b)

**Files:** `HeroSection.tsx`, `HowItWorksSection.tsx`, `IntegrationsSection.tsx`, `SkillsSection.tsx`

### Phase 6: Visual Assets (1 hour)

Update screenshots to show Timeline, not old dashboard.

- [x] Update screenshot manifest (`scripts/screenshots.yaml`) for timeline/search/session-detail
- [x] Update landing components to reference new image filenames (`timeline-preview.png`, `session-detail-preview.png`)
- [x] Generate screenshots with dynamic session IDs (commits b208cd61, f8b52e60)
- [x] Add Search as 3rd tab in ProductShowcase (commit e9be2bf5)
- [x] Reorder sections: product demo immediately after hero (commit 21681dd6)
- [x] Remove redundant DeploymentComparison section (commit 9a8cf1cc)
- [x] Fix meta tags/OG for HN sharing — was still "Swarmlet" branding (commit b446744a)
- [x] Remove 3.7MB dead images + 13 dead CSS rules (commits e9be2bf5, 5c637695)
- [ ] Add provider logos inline (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini) — nice-to-have

**Files:** `scripts/screenshots.yaml`, `public/images/landing/`, `HeroSection.tsx`, `ProductShowcase.tsx`

### Checklist (dev-tool landing page best practices 2025-26)

- [x] Above fold: Self-host primary, hosted beta secondary
- [x] Header: Docs + Pricing reachable in 1 click
- [x] CTAs: hero + header + mid-page + footer; labels match next step — normalized (commit 62108045)
- [x] Dark theme: text ≥ 4.5:1, UI components ≥ 3:1 (Phase 3 done; focus indicators still TODO)
- [x] Sticky header doesn't obscure focus / anchors
- [x] Self-host responsibilities spelled out

---

## [Launch] HN Launch Readiness — Remaining (4)

**Goal:** HN reader can install, see value immediately, understand what problem this solves, and start using it.

**Launch Path Decision:** OSS GA + Hosted Beta (optional).

### 🚨 Critical Blockers (Fix First)

- [x] **OSS Auth** — Password login for self-hosters (see dedicated section above)
- [x] **Password-only config bug** — `_validate_required()` now skips Google OAuth validation when password auth is configured
  - File: `apps/zerg/backend/zerg/config/__init__.py:512`
  - Fixed: Skip Google OAuth validation if `LONGHOUSE_PASSWORD` or `LONGHOUSE_PASSWORD_HASH` is set
- [x] **Landing page CTAs** — Copy/flow not dual-path; some CTAs route to sign-in modal instead of install/waitlist

### High Priority

- [x] **Demo mode flag** — `longhouse serve --demo` and `--demo-fresh` implemented
- [x] Installer enforces Python 3.12+ (align with `pyproject.toml`)

### Medium Priority

- [x] **Comparison table** — enhanced for HN launch (commit `f8496f4b`)
  - Shows how Longhouse compares to grep JSONL, Claude Code built-in history, and not tracking

- [x] **Social proof** — Author section in README (commit fd6848cb)
  - ~~Add testimonial or "Built by X" to README~~
  - ~~Show usage stats if you have any early users~~
  - ~~Link to personal Twitter/GitHub for credibility~~

- [ ] **Video walkthrough** (optional, 2 hours)
  - Remotion video studio at `apps/video/` — canonical video production pipeline
  - Landing page wired up — `DEMO_VIDEO_URL` points to `/videos/timeline-demo.mp4` with 404 fallback to placeholder
  - Remaining: run `make video-remotion-web` to render via Remotion, then add to README

---

## [Infra] Full Signup Flow (8)

**What it enables:** User clicks "Get Started" on longhouse.ai → Google OAuth → Stripe checkout → auto-provisioned instance at `{user}.longhouse.ai`

**Architecture:** Tiny FastAPI control plane handles signup/billing/provisioning. Uses Docker API directly (not Coolify). Runtime image bundles frontend + backend per user.

**Current state (2026-02-15):** OAuth, Stripe, webhooks, provisioning trigger, dashboard, provisioning status page, landing page CTAs, and **platform-provided email injection** all implemented. Control plane injects SES env vars into instances during provisioning (`provisioner.py:_env_for()`). Needs Google OAuth credentials + Stripe product setup + smoke test.

**Decisions / Notes (2026-02-04):**
- Control plane + user instances will live on **zerg** (single host for now).
- Do **not** use Coolify for dynamic provisioning; control plane talks to Docker directly.
- Proxy uses existing Coolify Caddy (caddy-docker-proxy) with caddy labels.
- Wildcard DNS `*.longhouse.ai` ✅ configured (2026-02-04), proxied through Cloudflare.
- Runtime image: `docker/runtime.dockerfile` bundles frontend + backend in single container.

### Phase 0: Routing + DNS Reality Check ⚠️ PARTIAL

- [x] Wildcard DNS `*.longhouse.ai` resolves via Cloudflare (verified 2026-02-05)
- [x] Routing layer: Caddy (coolify-proxy) with caddy-docker-proxy labels — verified working on zerg (2026-02-11). Labels `caddy=david.longhouse.ai` + `caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams 8000}}` route traffic correctly.
- [ ] Manual provision smoke test: test2/test3 instances provisioned + routed (needs rerun)
- [x] Add control-plane → instance auth bridge endpoint — dual-secret validation + email-based user resolution (commits `a2709611`, `d911d500`)

### Phase 1: Scaffold + Auth ✅

- [x] Create `apps/control-plane/` directory structure (FastAPI app, models, routers, services)
- [x] Add provisioner service (Docker API client with Caddy labels)
- [x] Add Instance model with subdomain, container_name, state
- [x] Admin API + minimal HTML UI for manual provisioning
- [x] Add User model with Stripe fields (fields only; no Stripe logic yet)
- [x] Add Google OAuth for control plane login/signup — `GET /auth/google` redirect + `/auth/google/callback` exchange + JWT session cookie + `get_current_user` dependency

### Phase 2: Stripe Integration (3)

**Pre-reqs:** `stripe` Python SDK not in dependencies yet. Add to `apps/control-plane/pyproject.toml`.

**Existing code:** `billing.py` and `webhooks.py` exist as stubs. User model has `stripe_customer_id` and `subscription_status` fields.

- [x] Add `stripe>=11.0` dependency to control plane `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Implement `POST /billing/checkout` — session auth, creates Stripe customer + checkout session
- [x] Implement `POST /webhooks/stripe` — signature verification + 4 event handlers (checkout.session.completed, subscription.updated, subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed)
- [x] Webhook: checkout.session.completed triggers auto-provisioning (derives subdomain from email, uniqueness check, calls Provisioner)
- [x] Implement `POST /billing/portal` — Stripe billing portal session
- [x] Add env vars to config + docker-compose: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
- [x] Idempotency: webhook checks subscription_status + existing instance before re-provisioning

### Phase 3: Docker Provisioning ✅ MOSTLY DONE

- [x] Implement Docker API client via local socket
- [x] Provision container with Caddy labels for subdomain routing
- [x] Create SQLite volume per user at `/var/lib/docker/data/longhouse/{subdomain}`
- [x] Implement deprovision (stop + remove container)
- [x] Add health check polling after provision — provisioning status page polls instance health
- [x] Build and push runtime image (`docker/runtime.dockerfile`) to ghcr.io — auto-builds on push via `runtime-image.yml`, publishes to `ghcr.io/cipher982/longhouse-runtime:latest`
- [x] Update CONTROL_PLANE_IMAGE to use runtime image — default now `ghcr.io/cipher982/longhouse-runtime:latest`
- [x] Wire provisioning trigger from Stripe webhook — checkout.session.completed → Provisioner.provision_instance()

### Phase 3.5: Provisioning E2E Gate ✅

- [x] Add CI provisioning script (`scripts/ci/provision-e2e.sh`) with real control-plane + instance smoke checks
- [x] Add GitHub workflow on cube ARC runners (`.github/workflows/provision-e2e.yml`)
- [x] Add CI-only port publishing + writable instance data root for provisioning tests

### Phase 4: Cross-Subdomain Auth (2) — DEFERRED

**Status:** Backend endpoints exist on both sides (CP `login-token` + instance `accept-token`). Dashboard currently links to instance URL directly; user uses instance's own password auth. Full cross-subdomain SSO deferred until needed.

- [x] Control plane `login-token` endpoint exists (issues JWT with `sub=user_id` + `email` claim)
- [x] Instance `accept-token` endpoint exists and handles CP-issued tokens (dual-secret validation)
- [ ] Wire auto-redirect after provisioning: dashboard "Open Instance" link could include accept-token for seamless SSO
- [ ] Handle returning users: "Sign In" → OAuth → find instance → redirect with token

### Phase 5: Landing Page + Control Plane UI ✅

- [x] Hero CTA: "Get Hosted →" → `control.longhouse.ai/auth/google`
- [x] Pricing CTA: "Get Started" on hosted tier → `control.longhouse.ai/auth/google`
- [x] Control plane home: shows "Sign in with Google" for unauthenticated, redirects to dashboard for authenticated
- [x] Dashboard: shows instance URL/status if provisioned, checkout button if not subscribed, provisioning redirect if in-progress
- [x] Provisioning status page: spinner + health poll + auto-redirect when instance is ready
- [x] Billing portal redirect: dashboard "Manage Billing" → Stripe portal
- [x] Removed WaitlistModal references from hero + pricing sections

### End-to-End User Journey

```
1. User visits longhouse.ai, clicks "Get Started"
2. → Redirects to control.longhouse.ai/auth/google
3. → Google OAuth consent screen
4. → Callback creates/finds User, sets control plane cookie
5. → If no subscription: redirect to /checkout
6. → Stripe Checkout (hosted page)
7. → On success: webhook fires checkout.session.completed
8. → Webhook handler: set subscription active, provision container
9. → User sees provisioning page (polls for health)
10. → Container healthy: redirect to alice.longhouse.ai?token=xxx
11. → Instance validates token, sets session cookie
12. → User lands on their Timeline, ready to connect CLI
```

**Files:** `apps/control-plane/`, `docker/runtime.dockerfile`, landing page components

**Infra status (verified 2026-02-11):**
- ✅ Control plane deployed via Coolify (`longhouse-control-plane`), healthy at `control.longhouse.ai/health`
- ✅ Caddy (coolify-proxy) on zerg handles subdomain routing via caddy-docker-proxy labels
- ✅ Wildcard DNS `*.longhouse.ai` resolves (verified 2026-02-05)
- ⚠️ Docker socket access from control plane container (needs verify)
- ⚠️ Postgres for control plane DB (separate container via docker-compose)
- ✅ Runtime image auto-builds on push via `runtime-image.yml` → `ghcr.io/cipher982/longhouse-runtime:latest`

## [Product] Frontend: Job Secrets UI (4)

**Goal:** Settings page where users manage job secrets with rich form fields powered by SecretField metadata. Backend API is complete (`GET /api/jobs/secrets`, `PUT /api/jobs/secrets/{key}`, `DELETE /api/jobs/secrets/{key}`, `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/secrets/status`). Needs React UI.

**Existing patterns (follow these):**
- **EmailConfigCard** (`apps/zerg/frontend-web/src/components/EmailConfigCard.tsx`) — newest card pattern for Settings page with status display, inline form, test button, save/delete. Follow this for secrets UI.
- **SettingsPage** (`apps/zerg/frontend-web/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`) — card-based sections, closest layout pattern
- **SwarmOpsPage** (`SwarmOpsPage.tsx`) — master-detail with list panel + detail panel (use for per-job secret status view)
- **UI components:** `Card`, `Input`, `Button`, `Badge`, `SectionHeader` — custom components, no external UI library
- **API client:** `services/api/` with domain modules (e.g., `services/api/sessions.ts`), uses react-query for cache/fetch
- **Auth:** HttpOnly cookie, no token management needed in frontend

### Phase 1: Secrets Management Page (3)

- [x] Add `services/api/jobSecrets.ts` — API client module (+ types: `JobSecretListItem`, `JobInfo`, etc.)
  - `listJobSecrets()` → `GET /api/jobs/secrets`
  - `upsertJobSecret(key, data)` → `PUT /api/jobs/secrets/{key}`
  - `deleteJobSecret(key)` → `DELETE /api/jobs/secrets/{key}`
  - `getJobSecretsStatus(jobId)` → `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/secrets/status`
  - `listJobs()` → `GET /api/jobs`
  - `enableJob(jobId, force)` → `POST /api/jobs/{id}/enable`
  - `disableJob(jobId)` → `POST /api/jobs/{id}/disable`
- [x] Add `hooks/useJobSecrets.ts` — React Query hooks for all operations
- [x] Add `pages/JobSecretsPage.tsx` — main secrets management page
  - Card 1: secrets table (key, description, configured badge, updated date, edit/delete)
  - Card 2: job status list with enable/disable toggle + secret indicators
  - Inline add/edit forms, delete confirmation
  - Secret values never displayed — show "configured" badge
- [x] Add route in `App.tsx` — `/settings/secrets`
- [x] Add nav link "Secrets" in `navItems.ts`
- [x] React-query hooks: `useQuery` for list, `useMutation` for upsert/delete with cache invalidation

### Phase 2: Per-Job Secret Status View (2)

- [ ] Add `components/JobSecretStatus.tsx` — shows which secrets a job needs and which are configured
  - Uses `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/secrets/status` response
  - Renders SecretField metadata: label (fallback to key), type hint, placeholder, description, required badge
  - Green check / red X for `configured` status
  - "Configure" button next to unconfigured secrets → opens upsert form pre-filled with key
  - Progress indicator: "3 of 5 secrets configured"
- [ ] Integrate into job detail view (wherever individual job config is shown)
  - If job list page exists: expand row or detail panel shows secret status
  - If not: standalone at `/jobs/{jobId}/secrets`
- [ ] Form rendering based on SecretField metadata:
  - `type: "password"` → password input (default)
  - `type: "text"` → text input
  - `type: "url"` → url input with validation
  - `placeholder` → input placeholder
  - `description` → help text below input
  - `required` → asterisk + validation
- [ ] Inline upsert form: user can configure a secret directly from the status view without navigating away

### Phase 3: Polish (1)

- [ ] Empty state for no secrets configured — guidance text + link to docs
- [ ] Toast notifications on save/delete success/failure
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: Escape to cancel form, Enter to submit
- [ ] Loading skeletons while fetching
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout (secrets page should work on tablet)

**Files:** `apps/zerg/frontend/src/pages/JobSecretsPage.tsx`, `apps/zerg/frontend/src/services/api/jobSecrets.ts`, `apps/zerg/frontend/src/components/JobSecretStatus.tsx`

---

## [Product] Pre-flight Job Validation (3)

**Goal:** Prevent jobs from running when required secrets are missing. Currently, enable/disable is a blind toggle — missing secrets only surface as runtime `RuntimeError` from `require_secret()` in `JobContext`. The status API (`GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/secrets/status`) already returns `configured: bool` per secret; this work wires that data into enforcement points.

**Current behavior:**
- `POST /api/jobs/{id}/enable` → sets `enabled=True`, no checks
- Job runs on schedule → `resolve_secrets()` returns empty string for missing keys → `ctx.require_secret("KEY")` raises `RuntimeError` → job fails with retry
- User sees failure in job history but has no upfront warning

**Target behavior:**
- Enable endpoint checks required secrets are configured → returns 409 with missing list if not
- Frontend shows warning before enable, blocks toggle if secrets missing
- Queue admission optionally skips jobs with missing required secrets (reduces noise)

### Phase 1: Backend Enforcement (2)

- [x] Add `_check_required_secrets(job_id, owner_id, db)` helper in `routers/jobs.py`
  - Calls `_normalize_secret_fields(config.secrets)` to get declared secrets
  - Checks DB + env for each required secret
  - Returns list of missing required secret keys (empty = all good)
- [x] Update `POST /api/jobs/{id}/enable` to call `_check_required_secrets()`
  - If missing secrets: return `409 Conflict` with `{"detail": {"message": "Missing required secrets", "missing": ["KEY1", "KEY2"]}}`
  - If all configured: proceed with enable as before
  - `POST /api/jobs/{id}/disable` does NOT check (always allows disable)
- [x] Add `force` query param: `POST /api/jobs/{id}/enable?force=true` bypasses check
  - For power users / env-var-only setups where secrets aren't in DB
  - Logs warning when force-enabled with missing secrets
- [ ] Optional: queue admission guard in `commis.py` `enqueue_scheduled_run()`
  - Before enqueueing, quick-check if required secrets exist
  - If missing, log warning and skip enqueue (don't crash, don't retry)
  - Configurable: `JOB_PREFLIGHT_ENABLED=true` env var (default true)

### Phase 2: Frontend Guards (1)

- [x] Job list/detail: show warning badge when required secrets are missing
  - `useJobSecretsStatus(jobId)` per job panel, shows `{configured}/{total} secrets` badge
  - Green/yellow dot indicators per secret
- [x] Enable toggle: if secrets missing, show 409-driven warning dialog
  - "This job requires N unconfigured secrets: KEY1, KEY2."
  - Buttons: "Configure Secrets" (scrolls to secrets section) / "Enable Anyway" (force=true) / "Cancel"
- [x] After configuring a secret, auto-refresh job status badges (react-query invalidation on `["job-secrets"]` + `["job-secrets-status"]`)

### Phase 3: Job History Context (1)

- [ ] When a job fails due to `RuntimeError` from `require_secret()`, tag the failure
  - Parse error_type in job run result — if `RuntimeError` and message matches "Secret .* not found", mark as `missing_secret` failure type
  - Show distinct UI treatment in job history: "Failed: missing secret KEY" with link to configure
- [ ] Add "last failure reason" summary to job list view — helps users see at a glance which jobs need attention

**Files:** `apps/zerg/backend/zerg/routers/jobs.py`, `apps/zerg/backend/zerg/jobs/commis.py`, frontend job components

## [Launch] Public Launch Checklist (6)

Ensure launch readiness without relying on scattered docs.

- [x] Rewrite README to center Timeline value and 3 install paths (FTS5 + resume/provider copy aligned).
- [x] Add CTA from Chat to "View session trace" after a run.
- [x] Improve Timeline detail header — status badge (completed/in-progress), environment badge, provider dot (commit `8c7db355`)
- [x] Add basic metrics — tool count, turn count, duration shown in header badges (commit `8c7db355`)
- [x] Add event role filters (All/Messages/Tools) in detail view (commit `8c7db355`).
- [x] Search within detail view — event text search added (commit `70acdc73`).
- [x] Core UI smoke snapshots pass (`make qa-ui-smoke`). — Baselines regenerated, all 4 tests pass (commit `fdad1dc2`).
- [x] Shipper smoke test passes — smoke test added (commit 08dbd87b).
- [x] Add packaging smoke test for future install.sh/brew path (if shipped). — packaging smoke test added (commit c27c9aed)

---

## [Launch] HN Post Notes (Condensed)

Keep the HN post short and problem-first. Use install.sh as the canonical path.

- **Title options:** "Show HN: Longhouse – Search your Claude Code sessions" · "Show HN: Never lose a Claude Code conversation again" · "Show HN: Longhouse – A local timeline for AI coding sessions"
- **Angle to emphasize (from industry research):** Context durability is the unsolved problem — benchmarks ignore post-50th-tool-call drift. Longhouse is the session archive that makes agent work durable and searchable. Lean into "your agents do great work, then it vanishes into JSONL" pain point.
- **Comment skeleton:** Problem (JSONL sprawl + context loss) → Solution (timeline + search + resume) → Current state (Claude Code + Codex + Gemini shipping, local-first) → Try it (`curl -fsSL https://get.longhouse.ai/install.sh | bash`, `longhouse serve`)
- **Anticipated Qs:** Why not Claude history? · Cursor support when? · Privacy? · Performance at scale? · How does this compare to just grepping JSONL?
- **Timing:** Tue–Thu mornings PT

---

## [QA/Test] README Test CI (Readme-Contract) (5)

Automate README command verification with explicit, opt-in contracts. Use cube ARC runners where possible.

- [ ] Define `readme-test` JSON block spec (steps, workdir, env, mode, timeout, cleanup).
- [ ] Implement `scripts/run-readme-tests.sh` (extract + run in temp clone, fail fast, save logs).
- [ ] Add `make test-readmes` target (smoke vs full mode flags).
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow using `runs-on: cube` for PR smoke and nightly full.
- [ ] Add `readme-test` blocks to root README + runner/sauron/hatch-agent READMEs.
- [ ] Optional: failure triage via `hatch` agent (summarize logs, suggest fix).

---

## [Product] Forum Discovery UX + Explicit Presence Signals (7)

Make the Forum the canonical discovery UI for sessions, with **explicit** state signals (no heuristics).

**Deliverables:** "Active/Needs You/Parked/Completed/Unknown" are driven by emitted events, not inference.

- [ ] Define a session presence/state event model (`session_started`, `heartbeat`, `session_ended`, `needs_user`, `blocked`, `completed`, `parked`, `resumed`) and document it.
- [ ] Add ingestion + storage for presence events in the agents schema (SQLite-safe).
- [ ] Update the Forum UI to group by explicit buckets and remove heuristic "idle/working" logic.
- [ ] Add user actions in Forum: Park, Snooze, Resume, Archive (emit explicit events).
- [ ] Wire wrappers to emit `session_started`/`heartbeat`/`session_ended` (Claude/Codex first).
- [ ] Add a single "Unknown" state in UI for sessions without signals (no pretending).

---

## [Product] OSS First-Run UX Polish (5)

Eliminate the "empty timeline" anticlimactic moment and improve discovery for users without Claude Code.

- [x] Seed demo session data on first run (auto-seeds on startup when sessions table is empty; `SKIP_DEMO_SEED=1` to disable)
- [x] Add guided empty state with "Load demo sessions" CTA + connect shipper steps
- [x] Improve "No Claude Code" guidance in onboard wizard (link to alternatives, explain what to do next)
- [x] `longhouse serve --demo` / `--demo-fresh` supported (demo DB)

---

## [Launch] Install + Onboarding Alignment (4)

Close the gap between VISION, README, docs, and the live installer.

- [x] **Canonical install path**: install.sh primary, README aligned, install guide created (commit 5757d63b)
- [x] **Document onboarding wizard**: `docs/install-guide.md` with wizard steps + troubleshooting + manual install (commit 5757d63b)
- [x] **Add `longhouse doctor`** (self-diagnosis for server health, shipper status, config validity); run after install/upgrade and recommend in docs
- [x] **Fix `longhouse connect` default URL** — `connect` + `ship` fallback changed from 47300 to 8080 (commit `426f8c9b`)
- [x] **Installer polish:** verify Claude shim + PATH in a *fresh* shell and print an exact fix line when it fails (commit `1600b094`)
- [x] **Hook-based shipping:** `longhouse ship --file` flag + Stop hook implemented (commit `17a978df`). Hook reads `transcript_path` from stdin JSON, ships single file incrementally. SessionStart hook shows recent sessions on new session start. Remaining: `longhouse connect --install` should auto-inject hooks into `.claude/settings.json`.
- [x] **AGENTS.md chain support:** Support Codex-style AGENTS.md chain (global → repo → subdir) in commis workspaces. Auto-inject Longhouse context (MCP server config, memory pointers) into workspace AGENTS.md when spawning commis.

---

## [Infra] OSS Packaging Decisions (3)

Close the remaining open questions from VISION.md.

- [x] Decide whether the shipper is bundled with the CLI or shipped as a separate package. **Decision: bundled.** Already part of the main package (`pyproject.toml` includes `watchdog`, CLI exposes `connect`/`ship`). Single `pip install longhouse` ships sessions out-of-the-box.
- [x] Decide shipper auth UX for `longhouse connect` (device token flow). **Decision: auto-token.** `longhouse connect` now auto-creates device tokens — tries unauthenticated first (AUTH_DISABLED), falls back to password login (`POST /api/auth/cli-login` → short-lived JWT → create token). Manual `longhouse auth` kept as fallback. Commits `a7c11f96`, `0435639d`.
- [x] Decide HTTPS story for local OSS (`longhouse serve`) — built-in vs reverse proxy guidance. **Decision: no built-in HTTPS.** HTTP on localhost is fine. For remote access, recommend Caddy or nginx reverse proxy (matches Grafana/Jupyter/Datasette pattern).
- [x] Capture current frontend bundle size and set a target budget. (2026-02-11: measured, budget set in VISION.md § "Frontend Bundle Size Baseline")

---

## [QA/Test] UI QA Screenshot Capture System (4)

**Goal:** Flexible, low-friction screenshot capture for agents + humans; clear instructions; minimal token cost.

- [ ] Inventory current screenshot/Playwright flows and pain points
- [ ] Prototype a simple capture CLI/API (local dev + headless) and document usage
- [ ] Add agent-friendly capture path (MCP/tool or skill) with stable output paths
- [ ] Add docs + examples; ensure instructions are short and reproducible
- [x] Fix ui-capture a11y snapshot: Playwright 1.57 has no `page.accessibility`; use `locator.ariaSnapshot()` or guard missing API and still write trace/manifest on partial failure
- [ ] Add SCENE=empty reset endpoint (or CLI) to clear sessions; update docs to note current no-op until available

---

## [Docs/Drift] Findings / Drift Audit (2026-02-05)

> 30+ items fixed as of 2026-02-10. Struck-through items archived -- see git history. Open items below.

**Open drift items:**
- [Infra/docs] DB size claim stale; prod DB reset 2026-02-05 (no users). Update docs/launch notes once data exists.
- [Docs vs release] PyPI version likely lags repo; verify `longhouse` version on PyPI before making release claims.
- [Docs vs UI] Timeline resume only in Forum Drop-In (Claude-only), not on `/timeline`. **Tracked** in "Public Launch Checklist."
- ~~[Docs vs code] Installer lacks PATH-based Claude shim + fresh-shell verification.~~ **FIXED** — fresh-shell PATH verification added (commit `1600b094`).
- ~~[Docs vs UI] Timeline empty state has no "Load demo" CTA.~~ **FIXED** — guided empty state with "Load demo sessions" button + connect steps.

## [QA/Test] QA Plan (Virtual QA Team) (2026-02-02)

(Former QA_PLAN.md. Keep this plan updated here only.)

Date: 2026-02-02
Owner: Longhouse (Zerg) core
Scope: SQLite-only, timeline-first product with dual-path positioning (self-host + hosted)

### Goals (Vision-Aligned)
- Zero-friction OSS onboarding (install + onboard + demo) works on first run.
- Timeline/demo data feels alive immediately (no API keys required).
- Session ingest is reliable and lossless (shipper -> ingest -> timeline).
- Background agents (commis/runners) are stable and debuggable.
- No waiting for bug reports: automated QA catches regressions before users do.

### Current QA Inventory (What We Already Have)
- Makefile test tiers: `make test` (SQLite-lite), `make test-legacy`, `make test-e2e` (core + a11y), `make test-zerg-e2e`, `make test-frontend-unit`, `make test-hatch-agent`, `make test-runner-unit`, `make test-shipper-e2e`, `make onboarding-sqlite`, `make onboarding-funnel`, `make qa-oss`.
- Playwright E2E with core suite + a11y, visual baselines, perf tests (some skipped).
- Backend pytest suites: unit + integration; SQLite-lite tests in `tests_lite/`.
- Docs-as-source onboarding contract + Playwright test for README contract.
- Shipper tests (unit + integration), runner unit tests.

### Gaps vs Vision (What’s Missing / Fragile)
1) Docs/landing copy still overpromise features (cross-device resume, multi-provider); no automated drift checks in CI.
2) Installer + CLI onboarding flows lack robust automated tests across OS targets.
3) Demo DB pipeline is new; no automated validation that demo DB builds and UI uses it.
4) E2E commis/session-continuity failures (timeouts) -> core suite stability risk.
5) Remaining E2E skips are perf/visual suites only; dev-only/event-bus + unimplemented-feature specs removed and tracked in TODO instead.
6) Shipper end-to-end is opt-in and skipped by default; no required CI gate.
7) Runner and commis execution lack full integration tests with real WebSocket channel.
8) Real-time events (SSE/WS) core coverage is enabled; advanced WS protocol/queue tests are deferred until backend ack support exists.
9) No formal OS matrix for OSS install (macOS/Linux/WSL).
10) OSS user QA script exists (`scripts/qa-oss.sh`), but CI wiring is still pending.
11) ✅ FIXED: Timeline search E2E is now part of `test-e2e-core` gating.
12) ✅ FIXED: Oikos session discovery tools now have unit coverage.
13) ✅ FIXED: FTS trigger integrity tests cover update/delete index consistency.
14) Scheduling/trigger management UI remains unimplemented; E2E specs removed until product work lands.

### Virtual QA Team (Agent Roles)
Use commis/runners + hatch agents to form a lightweight QA org that runs locally or in CI.

- QA Lead (Coordinator): owns test matrix + gating; assigns tasks to agents.
- Spec Guardian: parses VISION/README, flags drift, updates onboarding contract tests.
- Installer Guardian: validates `install.sh` and CLI `longhouse onboard` flows on macOS + Linux.
- Shipper Guardian: validates JSONL -> ingest -> timeline continuity.
- Commis/Runner Guardian: validates background jobs and runner_exec end-to-end.
- E2E Explorer: maintains Playwright core suite + a11y + visual baselines.
- Fuzzer: property-based + fuzz tests for APIs, websocket envelopes, ingest parser.
- Perf/UX Agent: enforces latency budgets and visual baseline stability.

### QA System Architecture (How It Runs)

#### 1) QA Matrix (what must be tested)

User Paths
- OSS local: install -> onboard -> demo -> timeline -> ingest -> search
- Hosted: signup -> instance -> timeline -> ingest -> session query
- Power user: runner -> exec -> commis -> session continuity

System Layers
- Unit (fast, deterministic)
- Integration (real DB, real services, mocked external LLMs)
- E2E (UI + API)
- Contract/Docs-as-Source
- Perf + Visual + A11y
- Security + Dependency hygiene

Data States
- Empty DB
- Demo DB (seeded SQLite)
- Real ingest from JSONL

Providers
- Claude Code, Codex, Gemini (parsers shipped 2026-02-10), Cursor (schema + ingest tests only)

#### 2) Tiered Test Gates

Tier 0 (local fast)
- lint-test-patterns, type checks, OpenAPI contract validation
- `make test` (SQLite-lite backend)
- `make test-frontend-unit`

Tier 1 (OSS path gate)
- `make onboarding-sqlite`
- Build demo DB + verify demo UI loads sessions
- CLI smoke: `longhouse onboard --quick --no-shipper` (headless)

Tier 2 (Core UX gate)
- `make test-e2e-core` (Playwright core, no skips)
- `make test-e2e-a11y`

Tier 3 (System gate)
- Shipper E2E with local backend (no skip)
- Runner + commis integration (websocket + task execution)

Tier 4 (Nightly)
- Full E2E suite, visual baselines, performance tests
- Optional live evals (requires API keys; runs on schedule)

#### 3) OSS QA Script (User-Run)

New script target: `scripts/qa-oss.sh` (or `longhouse doctor --full`).
Purpose: emulate the exact OSS user journey and catch regressions early.

Suggested flow:
1. Environment checks (Python/uv/bun, sqlite version)
2. Build demo DB (`demo-db`) and validate schema
3. Run `make onboarding-sqlite`
4. Boot demo stack (short-lived) and verify:
   - /api/health
   - /api/agents/sessions
   - demo timeline displays sessions
5. Run `make test` + `make test-frontend-unit`
6. Run `make test-e2e-core` (optional flag for CI vs local)
7. Print a short “OK / FAIL” summary

#### 4) LLM/Agent-Driven QA

- Test Synthesizer: generate Playwright tests from “journey specs” (YAML) and Vision changes.
- Failure Triage: summarize Playwright/pytest failures into reproducible steps + suspect areas.
- Regression Miner: when a bug is fixed, auto-suggest a new test case in the same area.
- Drift Checker: diff VISION/README to current UI selectors (CTA drift).

#### 5) Flake/Skip Elimination Strategy

- Replace “skipped until LLM mocking” with deterministic mock server.
- Convert flaky tests to stable selectors or API-assisted setup.
- Establish “no skip in core suite” rule; allow skips only in nightly/optional suites.

### Priority Backlog (Execution Plan)

P0 (now)
- Align README onboarding-contract with SQLite-first path.
- Add installer/CLI tests (install.sh, longhouse onboard, longhouse serve).
- Make demo DB build + demo load test part of OSS gate.
- Fix commis/session-continuity E2E timeouts (core suite must be 100% pass).
- Stabilize /api/health checks in tests (already in onboarding-sqlite).

P1 (next)
- Shipper E2E run in CI with a local backend (no skip).
- Runner + commis integration E2E (spawn runner, execute, verify run log).
- Unskip websocket/SSE tests by adding deterministic harness.
- Add LLM mock server for streaming tests (unskip chat_streaming, token tests).

P2 (after)
- Performance budgets (chat latency, timeline load) + baseline alerts.
- Visual baselines for landing + timeline + forum.
- Security/dependency scanning (npm audit + pip/uv audit).
- OS matrix for installer (macOS + Linux + WSL).

### Reporting & Artifacts
- Always collect Playwright traces and screenshots on failure.
- Export concise summaries: failed test, repro steps, suspected area.
- Store “last-known-good” test results and compare on regressions.

### Ownership & Cadence
- Per-PR: Tier 0 + Tier 1 + Tier 2 (core must pass).
- Nightly: Tier 3 + Tier 4.
- Release: all tiers + live evals (if keys available).

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Update onboarding contract to match SQLite-only path (no Docker). ✅
2. Add OSS QA script (new target) and wire to CI. ✅ (CI wiring pending)
3. Fix commis/session-continuity E2E failures and remove skip if possible.
4. Introduce deterministic LLM mock server so streaming tests can run.
5. Add demo DB validation to onboarding and E2E flows.
