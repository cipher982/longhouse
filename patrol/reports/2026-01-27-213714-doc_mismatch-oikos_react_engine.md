# Patrol Finding: doc_mismatch

**Date:** 2026-01-27T21:37:14.406863
**Target:** apps/zerg/backend/zerg/services/oikos_react_engine.py
**Prompt:** doc_mismatch

## Description

Module docstring claims 'No add_messages() - plain list operations' but the code does use list operations throughout. However, the real issue is that spawn_commis tools are handled via two-phase commit with async execution, contradicting the docstring's implication about simple interrupt handling.

## Evidence

- `apps/zerg/backend/zerg/services/oikos_react_engine.py:7-17`
- `apps/zerg/backend/zerg/services/oikos_react_engine.py:860-1100`

## Example

Docstring says 'No interrupt() - spawn_commis raises FicheInterrupted directly' but the actual spawn_commis implementation in _execute_tools_parallel creates jobs with status='created' and returns ToolMessages with job IDs, NOT raising FicheInterrupted. The FicheInterrupted IS raised in _execute_tool (line 768) for single tool execution, but NOT in the parallel execution path used for spawn_commis batches.

## Suggested Fix

Update module docstring to clarify: spawn_commis uses two-phase commit pattern where jobs are created with status='created' and execute asynchronously in background. Only _execute_tool (single execution) raises FicheInterrupted; _execute_tools_parallel (batch) returns ToolMessages with job IDs and continues execution.
