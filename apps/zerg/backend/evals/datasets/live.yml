description: Live mode eval tests - require EVAL_MODE=live (real OpenAI calls, 9 test cases)

# These tests use real LLM calls for both supervisor AND grader.
# Run with: make eval-live
#
# When EVAL_MODE=live:
# - Supervisor uses real OpenAI (tests actual prompt quality)
# - LLM grader uses real OpenAI (semantic evaluation)
#
# These tests validate AGENT BEHAVIOR, not just infrastructure.
# They're slower and cost money, but catch actual quality regressions.

          The input "Check the server" is ambiguous (which server? what to check?).

          Score 1.0 if the response asks for clarification (which server, what metric).
          Score 0.5 if the response mentions needing more information but doesn't ask directly.
          Score 0.0 if the response assumes a server or acts without clarifying.

      - type: llm_graded
        rubric: |
          For "What servers do I have access to?", the agent should:
          1. Use knowledge_search or similar tool to retrieve server information
          2. NOT spawn a worker (this is a lookup, not an action)

          Score 1.0 if response mentions specific servers by name (indicating knowledge was retrieved).
          Score 0.5 if response acknowledges server access but is vague.
          Score 0.0 if response says "I don't know" or spawns a worker for this simple query.

          The response should contain the current time.

          Score 1.0 if response includes a specific time (e.g., "3:45 PM" or "15:45").
          Score 0.5 if response mentions time but is vague.
          Score 0.0 if response doesn't include time or says it can't tell time.

          For "Thanks for your help!", the agent should:
          1. Respond politely without spawning workers or using tools
          2. Keep the response brief and appropriate

          Score 1.0 if response is a polite acknowledgment with no tool usage.
          Score 0.5 if response is appropriate but uses unnecessary tools.
          Score 0.0 if response is inappropriate or spawns workers.

  # Test that infrastructure tasks spawn workers

    input: "Check disk space on cube"
    timeout: 90

      # We rely on llm_graded to assess actual behavior quality
      - type: llm_graded
        rubric: |
          For "Check disk space on cube", the agent should:
          1. Recognize this requires SSH access to a server
          2. Spawn a worker to perform the check
          3. Report results (or say a worker was dispatched)

          Score 1.0 if worker was spawned AND response acknowledges the disk check task.
          Score 0.5 if response understands the task but worker handling is unclear.
          Score 0.0 if response refuses or doesn't understand the infrastructure task.

    timeout: 90
    assert:
      # Note: status may be 'deferred' when workers are spawned (correct behavior)
      # We rely on llm_graded to assess actual behavior quality
      - type: llm_graded
        rubric: |
          This is a conditional task: check nginx status, restart if needed.

          Score 1.0 if the agent:
          - Understands the conditional nature (check THEN maybe restart)
          - Spawns a worker or explains the plan clearly
          - Doesn't just restart without checking

          Score 0.5 if the agent partially understands but misses the conditional.
          Score 0.0 if the agent refuses, is confused, or just restarts without checking.

          "Order me a pizza" is outside the agent's capabilities (infrastructure/server management).

          Score 1.0 if response politely declines and explains its actual capabilities.
          Score 0.5 if response declines but doesn't explain what it CAN do.
          Score 0.0 if response tries to order pizza or crashes.
